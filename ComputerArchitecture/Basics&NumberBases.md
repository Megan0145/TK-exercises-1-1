##Â CHALLENGE ONE:

# Q1: How long does it take the number of transistors on a CPU to double? What is the common name for this rule of thumb?

Two years, although the cost of computers is halved. This is referred to as Moore's Law

# Q2: Why are registers necessary? Why not just use RAM?

Registers allow for quick access from the CPU because they are held within it (whereas RAM is connected to CPU via a memory bus -> takes longer to access). They hold the instructions that the CPU is currently processing whereas RAM holds the instructions & data that the CPU requires themselves. 

# Q3: Why is cache useful?

Cache is useful to allow for easy access to instructions and data from the CPU that have already previously been accessed along with instuctions and data the cache thinks the CPU may try to access in future. Eg when the CPU makes a call to address 2 in RAM for the first time, once it is retreived the cache will store it for easy retrieval the next time it is required, which will prevent the CPU from having to make another trip to RAM. It may also grab and store the contents of address 3, 4, and 5 on the assumption that the CPU may soon require them.

# Q4: What is a CPU word?

The CPU word is the size of the data with the which the CPU can interact with eg perform mathematical operations on in the ALU

# Q5: What is the system bus and how wide is it?

The system bus is  a collection of wires on the motherboard that allows for the transfer of data from the CPU to RAM and peripherals.
It is as wide as the the CPU word eg a 64-bit CPU has a 64-bit wide data bus.

# Q6: Describe the pins that are on a CPU chip

The pins on a CPU chip allow for an electrical connection between the CPU and the outside world. They are a formation of wires on the chip that fit into a socket on the motherboard/backplane that the CPU is attached to (these can be LGA, BGA OR PGA sockets).

# Q7: What is a CPU instruction?

A CPU instruction is a command that the CPU can fetch from RAM, interpret (decode) and execute some sort of action. It can take the form of a byte or a squence of bytes in memory and can be used to perform some sort of operation eg adding/multiplying two numbers in the ALU


## CHALLENGE TWO:

# Q1: Count to 0x20 in hex

0 -> 0x0
1 -> 0x1
2 -> 0x2
3 -> 0x3
4 -> 0x4
5 -> 0x5
6 -> 0x6
7 -> 0x7
8 -> 0x8
9 -> 0x9
10 -> 0xa
11 -> 0xb
12 -> 0xc
13 -> 0xd
14 -> 0xe
15 -> 0xf
16 -> 0x10
17 -> 0x11
18 -> 0x12
19 -> 0x13
20 -> 0x14
21 -> 0x15
22 -> 0x16
23 -> 0x17
24 -> 0x18
25 -> 0x19
26 -> 0x1a
27 -> 0x1b
28 -> 0x1c
29 -> 0x1d
30 -> 0x1e
31 -> 0x1f
32 -> 0x20

# Q2: What is 0x2F in binary?

2 * 16 = 32
1 * F = 15
32 + 15 => 47

# Q3: Convert 0b11011 to decimal

Add leading zeros -> 0001 1011

| 128 |  64 |  32 |  16 |  8  |  4  |  2  |  1  |
-------------------------------------------------
|  0  |  0  |  0  |  1  |  1  |  0  |  1  |  1  |

16 + 8 + 2 + 1 => 27

# Q4: What is 0b11100111 in hex?

Split into sequences of 4-bits -> 1110 0111

|           1110           |            0111          |
-------------------------------------------------------   
|   8 + 4 + 2 => 14 => E   |    4 + 2 + 1 => 7 => 7   |

Ans = 0xE7

# Q4: What is 27 in binary?

| 128 |  64 |  32 |  16 |  8  |  4  |  2  |  1  |
-------------------------------------------------
|  0  |  0  |  0  |  1  |  1  |  0  |  1  |  1  |

Ans => 0001 1011 / Obx11011
